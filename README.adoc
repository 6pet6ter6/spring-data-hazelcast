Welcome to Spring Data Hazelcast project!

The primary goal of the Spring Data project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies. 

Spring Data Hazelcast project aims to bring the Spring Data paradigm to gain the power of a distributed data repository.

=== Mail Group

Please, http://groups.google.com/group/hazelcast[join the mail group] if you are interested in using or developing Hazelcast.

== Motivation

The Spring platform is a commonly used environment. 
Therefore it is natural to provide a way to use Hazelcast via Spring in a standard, platform neutral manner and to provide a baseline implementation of Spring Data Hazelcast that can be enhanced in the future with Hazelcast specific features.

The implementation is built on the new Spring Data https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-keyvalue[KeyValue] module and is one of the first projects to do this. 
This module provides infrastructure components for creating repository abstractions for stores dealing with Key/Value pairs like `java.util.Map` or Hazelcast `IMap`.

Through the means of the repository interface, CRUD operations and expression-based query methods can interrogate an in-memory data store in a manner consistent with the other Spring Data projects so developers can become productive quickly and easily.

== Features

- Familiar "Spring Data" approach,  developers do not need to learn a new technology to be able to use it
- Utilizes the new Spring-Data-Keyvalue abstraction, we did not reinvent the wheel
- ​*FURTHER*​ eases the integration of Hazelcast into Spring and cloud
- Reduces vendor lock-in. One can swap Hazelcast in place of more expensive or slower options

== Usage

.Spring Configuration
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableHazelcastRepositories(basePackages={"example.springdata.keyvalue.chemistry"}) // <1>
public class ApplicationConfiguration {

    @Bean
    HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance() {     // <2> 
        return Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        // return HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient();
    }

    @Bean
    public KeyValueOperations keyValueTemplate() {  // <3> 
        return new KeyValueTemplate(new HazelcastKeyValueAdapter(hazelcastInstance()));
    }

    @Bean
    public HazelcastKeyValueAdapter hazelcastKeyValueAdapter(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {
        return new HazelcastKeyValueAdapter(hazelcastInstance);
    }
}
----
<1> Enables Spring Data magic for Hazelcast. 
    You can specify `basePackages` for component scan.
<2> Instantiates Hazelcast instance (a member or a client)
<3> Instantiates KV template

.A repository class definition
[source,java]
----
public interface SpeakerRepository extends HazelcastRepository<Speaker, Long> {}
----

.A test of repository
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = AppConfiguration.class)
public class AppTest {
    @Autowired
    SpeakerRepository speakerRepository;

    @Test
    public void testStart(){
        speakerRepository.findAll();
    }
}

----

== Installation

=== Maven

.Add this to your `pom.xml`
[source, xml]
----
<project>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>jitpack.io</id>
            <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.hazelcast-incubator</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-data-integrations-commons</artifactId>
        <version>0.8</version>
    </dependency>
</project>
----

==== Gradle

[source, groovy]
----
// Add it to your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}

// Add dependency
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.hazelcast-incubator:spring-data-integrations-commons:0.8'
}
